# MyBash--Text-Encrypter
this is just my bash script
to encrypt and decrypt text files and was created just for fun . 
it will shift every charater in the input text file with the previous one ( ex b --> a )

i am new and just learning bash ! 
i somehow make it work. but it might not work for complex text files 
and/or files containing charaters that this script won't understand 
please see the array namd "wor" in the script to get the understanding of what i am saying ! 

fix my code if you saw some bad coding and noo mistakes thx!
